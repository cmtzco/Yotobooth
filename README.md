Raspberry Pi Photobooth

This photobooth uses the snapchat unofficial API and the Yo! API for a photobooth built from a Raspberry Pi.  

The Yo! app controls the picture taking process by sending a request to the Pi via python.  This then uploads to the Pi and is sent to Snapchat using PHP. 

It's in its basic stages so if you find any bugs let me know.
